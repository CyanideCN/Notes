\item The electron configuration $(np)^1(mp)^1$ with $n\neq m$ has a total degeneracy of 36.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use Hund's rules as a guide to determine the term symbol for the lowest energy state(s). Include
          all J levels. You do not have to write out all 36 possibilities to do this part.
    \item Determine the total degeneracy of the term(s) obtained in part a.
    \item Write the wavefunction for the lowest energy state according to Hund.
    \item Show this function obeys the Pauli principle.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}\
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The combination of $2p$ and $3p$ has the lowest energy that satisfies the requirement.

              For $2p$ orbital, $m_l=1,0,-1$ and $m_s=\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2}$. And for $3p$, $m_l=2,1,0,-1,-2$,
              and $m_s=\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2}$.

              When $l=2$, the symbol is D, and corresponding J values are 3,2,1. This gives $^3D^3,^3D^2,^3D^1$.
    \end{enumerate}
